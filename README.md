# Vroom

This is a simple (and currently ugly) web application for tracking 1:1s with your employees, boss, and/or colleagues. It's named after [Victor Vroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Vroom), a business school professor at the Yale School of Management. Vroom's primary research was on the expectancy theory of motivation, which attempts to explain why individuals choose to follow certain courses of action in organizations, particularly in decision-making and leadership.

It is a weak clone of [Lighthouse](https://getlighthouse.com). [Jason Evanish](http://jasonevanish.com) has done an excellent job building a superb product. I suggest you visit the [Lighthouse website](https://getlighthouse.com) and sign up for a free trial. His service is significantly more polished than this weekend project.

## Background

I threw this together in a weekend as I wanted to build the core of different products. Note that I said core. As an example, Jason's excellent service will email you reminders and even allow you to email the folks you're having 1:1s with. The initial weekend 'MVP' omitted email. I may revisit this or this may be it, so feel free to fork it and expand upon it.
